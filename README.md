## Air-Quality-Index
Air quality has a significant impact on human health. Degradation in air quality leads to a wide range of health issues, especially in children. Day by day the air pollution becomes serious concern in India as well as in overall world. Proper or accurate prediction of Air Quality or the concentration level of other Ambient air 
pollutants such as Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Particulate Matter etc. is very important because impact of these factors on human health becomes severe. Earlier 
techniques such as Probability, Statistics etc. were used to predict the quality of air, but those methods are very complex to predict, the Machine Learning is the better approach to predict the air quality.

The proposed system is used to predict the air quality using the Machinelearning algorithms and overcomes the problems of Existing System. The Air pollutants 
information is retrieved from the sensors which are processed in a unified schema and stored as a dataset. This dataset is preprocessed. Once the dataset is ready, it is split into training dataset and test dataset. And further Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms are applied on the dataset. The Machine Learning algorithm applied on the dataset is
Linear Regression. The obtained results are matched with the testing dataset and results are analyzed.
